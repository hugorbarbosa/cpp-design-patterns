## Introduction

A software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design solution that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Software design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Note that using a design pattern doesn't mean necessarily a good design, because inappropriate use of patterns may unnecessarily increase the complexity of a given simple problem.

The software design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" was published in 1994. 23 design patterns were conceptualized in this book, divided into 3 categories:

- Creational patterns.
- Structural patterns.
- Behavioral patterns.

There are additional patterns that don't fall strictly under the traditional categories previously mentioned, being listed here in the "Other patterns" category. However, different sources may classify patterns differently, fitting some of these patterns within the existing categories, depending on the perspective of classification.

## Creational patterns

The Creational patterns offer the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Abstract Factory](./creational/Abstract_Factory.md).
- [Builder](./creational/Builder.md).
- [Factory Method](./creational/Factory_Method.md).
- [Prototype](./creational/Prototype.md).
- [Singleton](./creational/Singleton.md).

## Structural patterns

The Structural patterns demonstrate how different classes and objects can be organized to form larger structures and provide new functionality. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Adapter](./structural/Adapter.md).
- [Bridge](./structural/Bridge.md).
- [Composite](./structural/Composite.md).
- [Decorator](./structural/Decorator.md).
- [Facade](./structural/Facade.md).
- [Flyweight](./structural/Flyweight.md).
- [Proxy](./structural/Proxy.md).

## Behavioral patterns

The Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/Chain_of_Responsibility.md).
- [Command](./behavioral/Command.md).
- [Interpreter](./behavioral/Interpreter.md).
- [Iterator](./behavioral/Iterator.md).
- [Mediator](./behavioral/Mediator.md).
- [Memento](./behavioral/Memento.md).
- [Observer](./behavioral/Observer.md).
- [State](./behavioral/State.md).
- [Strategy](./behavioral/Strategy.md).
- [Template Method](./behavioral/Template_Method.md).
- [Visitor](./behavioral/Visitor.md).

## Other patterns

The "Other patterns" includes patterns that don't fall strictly under the previous categories. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)](./other/CRTP.md).
- [External Polymorphism](./other/External_Polymorphism.md).
- [Null Object](./other/Null_Object.md).
- [Type Erasure](./other/Type_Erasure.md).
