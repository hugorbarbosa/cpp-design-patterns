## Introduction

A software design pattern is a general reusable solutions to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design solution that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Software design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Note that using a design pattern doesn't mean necessarily a good design, because inappropriate use of patterns may unnecessarily increase the complexity of a given simple problem.

The software design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" was published in 1994. 23 design patterns are conceptualized, divided into 3 categories:

- Creational patterns.
- Structural patterns.
- Behavioral patterns.

## Creational patterns

The creational patterns offer the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Builder](./creational/Builder.md).
- Factories:
    - [Abstract Factory](./creational/Abstract_Factory.md).
    - [Factory Method](./creational/Factory_Method.md).
- [Prototype](./creational/Prototype.md).
- [Singleton](./creational/Singleton.md).

## Structural patterns

The structural patterns demonstrate how different classes and objects can be organized to form larger structures and provide new functionality. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Adapter](./structural/Adapter.md).
- [Bridge](./structural/Bridge.md).
- [Composite](./structural/Composite.md).
- [Decorator](./structural/Decorator.md).
- [Fa√ßade](./structural/Facade.md).
- [Flyweight](./structural/Flyweight.md).
- [Proxy](./structural/Proxy.md).

## Behavioral patterns

The behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. This category includes the following patterns:

- [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/Chain_of_Responsibility.md).
- [Command](./behavioral/Command.md).
- [Interpreter](./behavioral/Interpreter.md).
- [Iterator](./behavioral/Iterator.md).
- [Mediator](./behavioral/Mediator.md).
- [Memento](./behavioral/Memento.md).
- [Observer](./behavioral/Observer.md).
- [State](./behavioral/State.md).
- [Strategy](./behavioral/Strategy.md).
- [Template Method](./behavioral/Template_Method.md).
- [Visitor](./behavioral/Visitor.md).
